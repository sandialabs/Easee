# Easee
We present a new technique for identifying appropriate graph snapshots from a stream of communication events.  We call this technique EASEE 
(Edge Advertisements into Snapshots using Evolving Expectations).  The main Python codes are available in the central directory for 
reproducing our synthetic datasets, for running the two parts of the technique.

For an overview of the entire technique with descriptions of how it runs, how to interpret the outputs, etc. please see the notebook
located at https://github.com/sandialabs/Easee/blob/main/notebook_demo/EASEE_Demo.ipynb.
